### Project Description
A *living* keyboard that humorously evaluates your attempt to type Malayalam poetry in Manglish â€” so you grow to type ever faster these classic poems in a form no one will ever read.  At least you had fun, right?

### The Grand Problem
I feel a tangible absence of a program, that teaches someone to type faster Manglish poetry, in the space-time fabric.  Don't you feel it too?

### The Grand Solution
This abomination.

## Technical Details
Languages: Python 3.12

Packages used:
- `sshkeyboard` to read keystrokes
- `colorama` for a better interface to manage terminal colors
- `nava` to play audio
- `yaml` to parse typing test contents
